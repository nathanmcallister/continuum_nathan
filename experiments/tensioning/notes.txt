how generalizable are the results to a different setup of the same system?
 - registration
 - tension
 - built into the traning set

Orientation relative to gravity?
 - How much control effort is needed to counteract that
 - how does model performance get effected

Proposing what the control architecture looks like
 - Optimal control
 - Jacobian based? either 
 - How will this be used?

Say what the model is used for
